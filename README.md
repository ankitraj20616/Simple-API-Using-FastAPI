# Simple-API-Using-FastAPI
This project is the advance version of HTTP-Request-Methods(repo is aviable in my profile)
In this repository I have create all types of HTTP requests APIs using FastAPI package of Python, applied data validation on HTTP requests using pydantics library, applied custom successful and unseccessful request response using starlette library.
You should know about basics of python and some basics of asyncio package and FastAPI package to understand the code.

6. Now you will get the URL.
7. Now open the URL/docs in the browser, and you will finally open swagger UI of the API.
8. Now, see the responses of the API.
9. To close the URL press Ctrl+C in command prompt.
